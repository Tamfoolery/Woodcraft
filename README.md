Power:

	- Water wheel
	- Wind turbine (think the wind thing from the first level of Uru)
- Power converter to accept or convert to other power types

Plants:
- Abacá (produces Abacá leaves & seeds, used to create Abacá Rope, grown on dirt or grass to 2 blocks tall)

Misc:
- Drying frame (dry Abacá leaves into Abacá fibers)
- Abacá fibers (crafted into Abacá rope)

Machines:
- All machines have to be powered by KP
- Wooden quarry with changeable mining bit (respects mining level of blocks)

Quarry:
- Quarry consists of key block and frames, placed in a square, and the Quarry Miner placed on top of the key block(?)
- The quarry miner has an interchangeable mining piece (made from wood, stone, iron, or diamond) that gets damaged slowly over time
- When mining the Miner will work it's way, block by block, across each layer within the frame mining out the block beneath it if it can
- Key block placed in one corner - power in, mined items out
- The frame the quarry runs on is placed manually
- The miner is crafted using 4 runners (planks + 2 wooden gears), 4 rope, 1 log, 1 shaft (6 planks, down each side)
